# Hello Web Server

The Hello Web Server comes from the chapter 20 of [The Rust
Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book. In this
final chapter, a multithreaded web server is built. 

As usual with other Rust projects, you can compile and run it with
`cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

The server will run at *http://127.0.0.1:7878*.
